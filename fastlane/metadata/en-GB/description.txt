TripUp is a privacy-focused photo backup and sharing app.

• BACKUP: Backup all your photos in original quality with end-to-end encryption.

• SHARING: Share encrypted photos privately with others via shared albums.

• MERGED ALBUMS: Share individual photos in an album with a group of users and keep the rest to yourself. Forget about making one private and one shared album for every event!

• CONSOLIDATED LIBRARY: Photos shared by others will be smart-merged into your main library. No need to copy photos from a shared album to your main library anymore!

• MULTIPLE LOGINS: Use your phone number, e-mail or Sign in with Apple ID.

• PRIVATE: All photos and metadata are end-to-end encrypted using PGP encryption with Curve25519 keys. Use Sign in with Apple ID and share your profile via a profile link – no need to hand out your email or phone number to others!

• CROSS-PLATFORM API: Access your photo library from multiple devices and platforms.

• OPEN SOURCE: Both server and client apps are open source.

It's 2021 – it's about time we had an easy to use photo backup and sharing app that respects our privacy!
